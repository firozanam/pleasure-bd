## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any of the following issues:

1. "price is not defined" error:
   - Ensure that you're properly extracting the price from your product data in the edit product page.

2. Recursion errors:
   - Check for circular dependencies in your components.
   - Verify that useEffect hooks have proper dependency arrays.
   - Review any recursive functions for proper base cases.

3. Vercel Blob token error:
   - Make sure to set the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` in your environment variables.
   - Pass the token when using Vercel Blob functions in your code.

For more detailed troubleshooting, please refer to the error messages in your browser console or server logs.

## File Management

This project uses Vercel Blob for file storage. To manage files:

1. Ensure the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is set in your environment variables.
2. The file manager uses a server-side API route (`/api/files`) to securely fetch and manage files.
3. Make sure the API route has the necessary permissions to access Vercel Blob.

If you encounter issues with file management, check the following:

- Verify that the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is correctly set in your environment variables.
- Ensure that the API route (`app/api/files/route.js`) is properly configured and can access the environment variables.
- Check the server logs for any errors related to Vercel Blob access or token issues.
